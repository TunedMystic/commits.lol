Commits.lol is a service that collects funny commit messages from Github.

The commits are randomized on every page load, but you can also randomize commit messages with the emoji buttons!

ðŸ˜‚ = funny commits

ðŸ’© = poop-related commits

ðŸ˜‡ = cry-for-help commits

ðŸ¤¬ = _turn the censoring on/off_

<br />

### How does it work?

It uses Github's REST API to fetch commits with bits of profanity ðŸ˜›.

The messages are then censored, color coded and saved to the db.

New commits are fetched from Github every hour.

<br />

### What's the tech stack?

The backend is built with Go _(Mux, Sqlx and friends)_

The frontend is plain HTML and JS. Tailwind for CSS.

The database is SQLite.
